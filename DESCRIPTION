Description: CGRphylo provides an efficient alignment-free approach for 
    phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes using Chaos Game Representation (CGR). 
    It accurately classifies closely related viral strains, including recombinants, 
    making it particularly valuable during epidemic outbreaks where thousands of 
    viral sequences need rapid analysis. The package processes genomic sequences 
    significantly faster than traditional multiple sequence alignment methods 
    (5-13.7x faster than Clustal-Omega), with computational cost that scales 
    linearly rather than quadratically with dataset size. It is designed for both 
    high and low-resource settings, creating frequency matrices for each sequence 
    that can be used to calculate distances and construct phylogenetic trees.
